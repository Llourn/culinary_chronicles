## Description

Culinary_Cronicles is a group project. It is a one page application using React. We are all foodies in our group and we decided to make an application where user can make account and add their recipes for other people to use and can search other recipes. You can find recipes with preparation time.
It help users to try new recipes. We all like to try new food but are we ready to cook? By having all the recipes, with ingredients used and preparation time, we would be encouraged to cook and try healthy homemade food on budget as restaurants are expensive.

## Installation

To install locally, Git clone this repository using terminal and open the file in VS Code (or in the editor you work with). Install dependencies using "npm install" in terminal (make sure that you are in the reposetory directory, before running any command) followed by "npm run seed" and "npm run develop" to start the apllication. Now you are ready to use this application.

To use the application online, go to the Heroku link and it is ready to use.
